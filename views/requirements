Part 1. You create these 4 functions: students, comment, video, login/logout

For students, the application should have functions shown in the diagram (see
separate diagram file)

- show all of the students, add new student, show each students info. Edit each
students, delete student

You need to create a student table for student information. It should have student
firstname, lastname, birthday, address, student id, and other properties you like.

For comment, the application will be able to:
- show all the comment (with timestamp)
- create new comment
- show a specific comment (by clicking on it), with name, time created, and comment
content

You need to create a comment table for comment information. It should have name of
the person, comment. You need also create more route handlers.

For timestamp, create a “created_at” property, Sinatra will automatically fill this field with
time when the comment is created.
